        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This shipwreck casserole might not be pretty, but it is a tasty, busy-night, kid-friendly meal. The prep time is generally limited to how fast your can opener works and how hard it is to unwrap your meat. The big bonus is that it's a complete one-pot meal!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>

        </ul>
